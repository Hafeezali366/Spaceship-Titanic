# Spaceship Titanic: EDA Summary & Recommendations for Modeling

This document provides a summary of the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) conducted on the Spaceship Titanic dataset, followed by recommendations for feature engineering and model selection.

## 1. Summary of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA provided a solid foundation for understanding the dataset's structure, quality, and predictive features.

### Dataset Overview
*   **Shape:** The training data contains **8,693 rows** and **14 columns**.
*   **Task:** The goal is a **binary classification** task to predict the `Transported` column.

### Target Variable: `Transported`
*   **Distribution:** The target variable is almost perfectly **balanced**.
    *   ~50.4% Transported (`True`)
    *   ~49.6% Not Transported (`False`)
*   **Implication:** This balance means **accuracy** is a suitable primary evaluation metric, and techniques for handling class imbalance (like over/under-sampling) are likely not required.

### Key Findings from Feature Analysis
*   **Numerical Features (`Age`, `RoomService`, `Spa`, etc.):**
    *   All spending-related columns are heavily **right-skewed**, with most passengers having zero or low spending.
    *   **Strong Signal:** Lower (or zero) spending on luxury amenities is strongly correlated with a higher probability of being `Transported`. The box plots and violin plots with a log scale effectively highlighted this pattern.

*   **Categorical Features (`HomePlanet`, `CryoSleep`, etc.):**
    *   **`CryoSleep`:** This is the single **most powerful predictor**. Passengers in `CryoSleep` are far more likely to be transported (~80% success rate).
    *   **`HomePlanet`:** Passengers from **Europa** have a higher transport rate than those from **Earth**.
    *   **`Destination`:** This feature has a weaker, but still present, predictive signal.
    *   **`VIP`:** Appears to have a **weak predictive signal**, as transport rates are similar for VIPs and non-VIPs.

*   **Data Quality & Correlations:**
    *   **Missing Values:** There are a significant number of missing values across most feature columns, which must be addressed before modeling.
    *   **Correlations:** The numerical features exhibit very **low correlation** among themselves, suggesting they provide independent information.

## 2. Recommendations for Data & Feature Engineering

Based on the EDA, the following data preprocessing and feature creation steps are recommended.

### 1. Handling Missing Values (Imputation)
*   **Numerical Columns (`Age`, spending columns):** Impute with the **median** rather than the mean to mitigate the effect of the highly skewed distributions.
*   **Categorical Columns (`HomePlanet`, `Destination`, `VIP`):** Impute with the **mode** (most frequent value).
*   **Advanced `CryoSleep` Imputation:** For rows where `CryoSleep` is missing but total spending is zero, impute `CryoSleep` as `True`. For all other missing `CryoSleep` values, use the mode. This leverages the strong relationship discovered in the EDA.

### 2. Feature Engineering (Creating New Features)
*   **`Cabin` Processing:** Split the `Cabin` column (e.g., `B/0/P`) into three distinct features, as each part may hold unique predictive power:
    *   `Deck` (e.g., 'B')
    *   `CabinNum` (e.g., 0)
    *   `Side` (e.g., 'P')
*   **`PassengerId` Processing:** Split `PassengerId` (e.g., `0001_01`) to create a `GroupId` feature. Passengers in the same group might have shared outcomes. You can also derive `GroupSize`.
*   **Create Spending Features:**
    *   `TotalSpending`: Sum of `RoomService`, `FoodCourt`, `ShoppingMall`, `Spa`, and `VRDeck`.
    *   `NoSpending`: A binary feature that is `True` if `TotalSpending` is 0. This directly captures one of the strongest signals from the EDA.
*   **Drop Unnecessary Columns:** The `Name` column should be dropped as it is unlikely to contain predictive value for a general model.

### 3. Encoding & Scaling
*   **Categorical Encoding:**
    *   **Label Encoding:** Use for binary features like `CryoSleep`, `VIP`, and the new `Side` feature.
    *   **One-Hot Encoding:** Use for multi-class features like `HomePlanet`, `Destination`, and the new `Deck` feature to avoid introducing an artificial order.
*   **Numerical Scaling:**
    *   **RobustScaler:** Recommended for numerical features (`Age`, `TotalSpending`, etc.) because it is robust to the outliers identified in the EDA. A `StandardScaler` is a viable alternative.

## 3. Recommendations for Model Selection

### 1. Baseline Model
*   **Logistic Regression:** An excellent choice for a baseline. It's simple, fast, and provides interpretable coefficients, which can validate the feature engineering steps.

### 2. Primary Model Candidates
For this type of tabular data problem, tree-based ensemble models are expected to perform the best.
*   **Random Forest:** A robust and reliable model that is less prone to overfitting and generally performs well out-of-the-box.
*   **Gradient Boosting Machines (GBMs):**
    *   **LightGBM:** Highly recommended due to its speed and excellent performance on tabular data. It's great for quick experimentation.
    *   **XGBoost:** A powerful and popular alternative, often a top performer in similar classification tasks.
    *   **CatBoost:** A strong contender, especially due to its sophisticated built-in handling of categorical features, which can sometimes simplify the encoding pipeline.

### 3. Evaluation Strategy
*   **Metric:** Since the classes are balanced, **Accuracy** is a very good primary metric. For a more comprehensive evaluation, also track the **AUC-ROC score**.
*   **Validation:** Use **Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation** (with 5 or 10 folds) to get a reliable and robust estimate of model performance across the entire dataset.
